# Facial Recognition and Movement Detection

The BS folder contain some script test for Facial Recognition and Movement Detection. Also have a file called requirements.txt, that is used to set the venv.

These tasks are based on OpenCV2 library.

The codes are

- [cameratest.py](https://github.com/Marivera3/Diseno/blob/master/BS/cameratest.py): It is for know how to use the camere with the library.
- [camperatest2.py](https://github.com/Marivera3/Diseno/blob/master/BS/cameratest2.py): Show the detection movement based on Background Substrasting.
- [cameratest3.py](https://github.com/Marivera3/Diseno/blob/master/BS/cameratest3.py): Show the facial recognition using the HaarCascade algorithm.
- [maintest1.py](https://github.com/Marivera3/Diseno/blob/master/BS/maintest1.py): Mixed the last 2 codes and only detects faces when detect movements.
- [showmotion.py](https://github.com/Marivera3/Diseno/blob/master/BS/showmotion.py): Add blue square to the pixels that moves.


For Haar Cascade you can search here:

Some usefull information of the HaarCascade:

In the folder FacialDetection is an optimized code. Here we use an OpenCVâ€™s deep learning face detector,based on the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework with a ResNet base network. Implemented in Caffe.
